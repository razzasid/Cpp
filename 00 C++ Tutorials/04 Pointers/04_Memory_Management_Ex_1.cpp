// C++ Dynamic Memory Allocation

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // declare an int pointer
    int* pointInt;

    // declare a float pointer
    float* pointFloat;

    // dynamically allocate memory
    pointInt = new int;
    pointFloat = new float;

    // assigning value to the memory
    *pointInt = 45;
    *pointFloat = 45.45f;

    cout << *pointInt << endl;
    cout << *pointFloat << endl;

    // deallocate the memory
    delete pointInt;
    delete pointFloat;

    return 0;
}

// In this program, we dynamically allocated memory to two variables of int and float types. After assigning values to them and printing them, we finally deallocate the memories using the code

// delete pointInt;
// delete pointFloat;
// Note: Dynamic memory allocation can make memory management more efficient.

// Especially for arrays, where a lot of the times we don't know the size of the array until the run time.
